\section{Data dredging}

Data dredging (data fishing, data snooping) is the inappropriate (sometimes deliberately so) use of data mining to uncover misleading relationships in data. Data-snooping bias is a form of statistical bias that arises from this misuse of statistics. Any relationships found might appear to be valid within the test set but they would have no statistical significance in the wider population.

Data dredging and data-snooping bias can occur when researchers either do not form a hypothesis in advance or narrow the data used to reduce the probability of the sample refuting a specific hypothesis. Although data-snooping bias can occur in any field that uses data mining, it is of particular concern in finance and medical research, both of which make heavy use of data mining techniques.
